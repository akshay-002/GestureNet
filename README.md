# Gesture Recognition using ResNet50


This project implements a gesture recognition system using a modified ResNet50 architecture. The system is trained on a dataset of images representing various hand gestures and aims to classify them into one of ten categories. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.


- **Custom ResNet50 Architecture**: Includes identity and convolutional blocks.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Organizes and visualizes input data.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Splits data, trains the model, and evaluates performance.
- **Visualization**: Plots training accuracy, loss, and test set evaluation.
